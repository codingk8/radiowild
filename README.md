## What it does

##### Requirements were to build a POC for a solution allowing students to choose a background music :notes: to play on the campus.

##### Our idea was to suggest some music genres and allow people to vote. Then play the music genre chosen in the votes.

## How it works

##### Built with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* Web radios
